# AutoClipUploader

Contributors: Sree Chinta, Samik Pradhan

## Overview

This project allows users to automatically upload videos from a local folder onto YouTube. The video files must be in the `.mp4` format. The files that get successfully uploaded will be put into an `Uploaded/` folder.

## How to run

1) Acquire access to the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) and store your `client_secrets.json` file in the same directory as `main.py`.
2) Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python libraries needed for the program to run
3) Run the `main.py` file and select the local folder with the clips you want to upload

## Notes

This project currently only runs on Windows and Linux systems.
